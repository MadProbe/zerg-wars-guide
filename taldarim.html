Tal'darim Guide</h1></div><div class=content><h1>Strategy one: Tank and dps alarak (Regular)</h1><b>Step 1:</b> Pick Alarak<br><b>Step 2:</b> When game starts, immediately buy 1 upgrade for destruction wave damage and 1 destruction wave Cooldown<br><b>Step 3:</b> Send alarak to either the top of your side (Where the first 2 turrets are) and stay there.<br>This can constantly send zerglings which you can instant kill with wave and the turrets will help sustain you with their attacks.<br>If none of your teammates push out to farm zerglings in the early game, push to the middle of the map.<br>It has less area which means it makes it harder for you to die to the zerglings but you will get lesser feed but it’s a more safer route to take while alone<br><b>Step 4:</b> Buy upgrades in this order (After the first wave damage and Cooldown upgrades)<ol><li>Max destruction wave Cooldown</li><li>Buy the upgrade which grants extra kb to wave</li><li>Max wave damage</li><li>Soul absorption</li></ol><b>Step 5:</b> At the 3 minute mark, roachs starts to spawn.<br>If you have no teammates which can kill the roaches, fall back to the planetary fortress as you are to weak to solo large amount of roaches.<br>Pro tip: Constantly make sure you are using wave to kill large groups of Zerg and use the wave to save yourself from a sticky situation<br><b>Step 6:</b> Once you maxed out the early game upgrades, buy a probe and build 1 pylon and 6 gateways.<br>Once the 6 gateways are built, active the wrath of the Tal’darim abilities and push the Zerg back<br><b>Tip:</b> You can either choose to save to buy gateway upgrades or leave it but I recommend you don’t yet<br><b>Step 7:</b> Buy 1 1 1<br><b>Step 8:</b> Build a cybernetic core<br><b>Step 9:</b> Buy 3 3 3<br><b>Step 10:</b> Max our warp acceleration upgrades for the extra supply<br><b>Step 11:</b> Buy these upgrades in these order Max Armor and regen upgrade (You get 6 3 6).<br><ol><li>Buy 6 shield upgrades.</li><li>Buy 6 health upgrades.</li><li>Max out Attack speed.</li><li>Buy stun for basic Attack</li><li>Either:<ol><li>buy 22 damage upgrades</li><li>max out deadly charge or blood blade in any order (Make sure these are all bought)</li><li>Buy alarak overcharge and sacrifice upgrade</li></ol></li></ol><b>Step 12:</b> You can now branch off into different ways of playing if you reach this point:<br><ol><li>Continue buying damage, shield and health upgrades.<br>Reason: Do this is your teammates are having difficulties defending or if you wanna just help out.</li><li>Buy a spire and start spamming wrathwalkers (Make sure you buy the upgrades for wrathwalkers if you choose to go this route).<br>Reason: If there seems to be a stalemate, wrathwalkers are extra amazing at sniping defences without be caught by most units, if you can stack up to 10+ wrathwalkers every 90 seconds, it becomes very frustrating to the enemy and it almost guarantees you the victory if the enemy doesn’t kill your wrathwalkers.</li><li>Max out gateway (It’s a personal preference if you want more sustain)<br>Reason: Maxing out gateways can help give alarak sustainability as there will be more units alarak can sacrafise to save his sorry ass, you don’t need this if your gonna going with option 2 or you don’t die a lot.</li></ol><h1>Strategy 2: Stalker rush (Very risky)</h1><b>Step 1:</b> Pick Alarak<br><b>Step 2:</b> Buy one destruction wave damage upgrade and repeat step 3 and 5 from strategy 1 (Do not buy extra upgrades)<br><b>Step 3:</b> Buy a probe and build 6 gateways (Make sure 4 gateways are sending stalkers and 2 or building sentries are sending stalkers) and a cybernetics core<br><b>Step 4:</b> Buy the first upgrade for stalker (Taking damage makes them invincible for like 1 second I think)<br><b>Step 5:</b> Buy 1 warp acceleration upgrade and build pylons (Near your teammates defences for the Attack speed bonus) until you reach a supply count you like (125-200).<br><b>Step 6:</b> Use Wrath of Tal’darim ability to stalker spam the enemy.<br><b>Step 7:</b> Prey the enemy is dumb and doesn’t counter it well.<br><b>Step 8:</b> If you win, you win.<br><b>Step 9:</b> If that dose not finish the game, continue from step 6 from strategy 1 (Make sure you max wave and soul absorption).<br><h1>Strategy 3: Spire rush (Requires good teammates who know how to defend)</h1><b>Step 1:</b> Pick Alarak.<br><b>Step 2:</b> Buy one destruction wave damage upgrade and repeat step 3 and 5 from strategy 1 (Do not buy extra upgrades).<br><b>Step 3:</b> Make a probe and build a spire.<br><b>Step 4:</b> Start buying spire units untill you get wrathwalkers.<br><b>Step 5:</b> Buy 3 3 3 for elite units and buy the upgrades for the unit you wish to spam.<br><b>Step 6:</b> Choose a unit you wish to spam with the spire (Assendent, Vanguards, Wrathwakers).<br><b>Step 7:</b> Either your spire units break through the enemy defences or you lose cuz your defence fail cuz you only have 3 people defending while the enemy has 4.<br><h1>Pro tips</h1>If the enemy tries to harass your base, alarak is good at shutting them down if played correctly (Charge towards enemy units, wave, run away repeat)<br>Alarak can be placed in a warp prisim and can be sent to the Zerg spawn to shut down hatchires or nyrus worms.<br>Death fleet can be upgraded Using alarak structure overcharge and mengsk forced conscription together can cause massive economy damage to the enemy if used correctly.<br>Don’t even buy Tal’darim drops, they suck. (Invest your money into a spire instead)<br>Don’t leave deadly charge on auto cast if you want to stop a harass.<br>Your ultimate (Thic Alarak) can give you the boost to shut down most attacks and hatcheries bases so use them when absolutely necessary, don’t use it randomly.<br>At late game alarak can tank 2-3 stanks.<br>if you build correctly so you can save your teammates buildings.<br>Death fleet isn’t good against high hp targets, use them to clear large amount of zergs or when alarak died and you gotta wait like 10 years for him to come back.<br>Always use your structure overcharge when the opportunity presents itself, it is really good in helping out in defences and harass.<br>Buying accendents can be very good investment but very risky, there orb thingy Attack is like a alarak wave in a nutshell but way more powerful when stacked.<br>When buying accendents, make sure you buy the upgrades for them and keep them FAR FAR away from alarak. Alarak will give 0 shits about his workers and will even sacrafise maxed accendents (Sacrafised 10 supplicants) for himself All elite units suck except Accendents while defending Use Wrath of Tal’darim when it is off Cooldown.<br>PLS PLS Build pylons near your teams defences in late game as they give an Attack speed boost to your teams defences, also buy the upgrade for the Attack speed. It’s just like a few hundred minerals for 15% Attack speed for your team defences.<br>Getting 200 supply is nice but not really needed Getting the thermal lance upgrades makes your buildings near alarak’s mothership immune to small harrasses Ravanger rushes can be easily murdered by one good destruction wave which does 125 damage (1 upgrade from maxed).<br>If Alarak is in a warp prisim, don’t let the prisim die. Cuz Alarak will die too.<br>If coordinated with a Protoss player, you can combine Super fast photon cannons (Tal’darim cannons) with shield batteries rather than a normal photon cannon.<br>Key bind alarak, your mothership, your probe and your spire.<br>Pylons doesn’t provide you with eco so don’t bother spamming them Death fleet and wrath of Tal’darim Cooldown is only 5 mins.<br></div></div><footer class="card site-footer"><p>Made and maintaned by MadProbe#7435</p><button class=tt><em class=sun id=tt></em> <span id=bt></span></button><noscript>Theme switching is not working without JavaScript enabled!</noscript></footer></div></div></body></html>
